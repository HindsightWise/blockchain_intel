# Technical Architecture

## System Overview

The Blockchain Intelligence Platform is designed as a scalable, modular system that processes, analyzes, and visualizes blockchain data. The architecture follows a microservices approach with clear separation of concerns between different components.

## Core Components

### Data Ingestion Layer

Responsible for extracting data from blockchain networks and preparing it for storage and analysis.

- **Blockchain Indexers**: Connect to blockchain nodes, process blocks, and extract transactions.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Transform raw blockchain data into structured formats.
- **Data Validation**: Verify data integrity and consistency.

### Storage Layer

Manages the persistent storage of blockchain data, entity information, and user data.

- **Graph Database (Neo4j)**: Stores entity relationships and transaction flows.
- **Time-series Database (InfluxDB)**: Stores historical price and transaction volume data.
- **Search Index (Elasticsearch)**: Enables fast address and entity searches.
- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores user data, subscriptions, and platform configuration.

### Processing Layer

Handles the analysis, enrichment, and intelligence extraction from blockchain data.

- **Entity Identification Service**: Clusters addresses and maps them to real-world entities.
- **Transaction Analysis Service**: Analyzes transaction patterns and identifies anomalies.
- **Risk Scoring Engine**: Calculates risk scores for addresses based on behavior patterns.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Trains and applies ML models for pattern recognition and prediction.

### API Layer

Provides standardized interfaces for accessing platform functionality.

- **REST API**: Serves data to the frontend and external consumers.
- **GraphQL API**: Provides flexible data querying capabilities.
- **WebSocket API**: Delivers real-time updates and notifications.

### Frontend Layer

Delivers the user interface and visualization components.

- **React Application**: Main web application with responsive design.
- **Visualization Components**: Interactive charts, graphs, and transaction flow diagrams.
- **Dashboard Framework**: Customizable dashboard with widgets and configurations.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Blockchain nodes provide raw block and transaction data.
2. **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines transform and enrich the raw data.
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in appropriate databases.
4. **Data Analysis**: Processing layer extracts insights and intelligence from stored data.
5. **Data Access**: API layer provides access to processed data and insights.
6. **Data Presentation**: Frontend layer visualizes data and presents it to users.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Each component can be independently scaled based on load.
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data.
- **Data Partitioning**: Sharding strategies for large datasets.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Message queues for handling processing workloads.

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions.
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit.
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and request signing.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and security event monitoring.

## Deployment Architecture

- **Containerization**: Docker containers for all components.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring.

## Integration Points

- **Blockchain Nodes**: Direct connection to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana nodes.
- **External Data Sources**: Integration with exchange APIs, news sources, and on-chain data providers.
- **Authentication Providers**: OAuth integration for social login.
- **Payment Processors**: Integration for subscription management.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Go (for performance-critical components)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material UI, D3.js
- **Databases**: Neo4j, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL
- **Processing**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, TensorFlow
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP
