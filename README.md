# Blockchain Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive platform for blockchain transaction analysis, entity identification, and data visualization focused on security, speed, accuracy, and exceptional user experience.

## Project Vision

This platform aims to provide actionable insights into blockchain transactions and entities through intuitive visualizations, powerful search capabilities, and advanced analytics. Initially focused on Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, with plans to expand to additional blockchains including Solana.

## Key Features

- **Entity Identification**: Mapping addresses to real-world entities with confidence scoring
- **Transaction Flow Visualization**: Intuitive visual representation of fund movements
- **Cross-Chain Analytics**: Tracking transactions across multiple blockchains
- **Advanced Search**: Find addresses, entities, and transactions with powerful filtering
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Personalized views of blockchain data
- **Alert System**: Notifications for specific transaction patterns or entity activities

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- API Server: Node.js with Express
- Performance-Critical Components: Go
- Databases:
  - Graph Database: Neo4j (for entity relationships)
  - Time-series Database: InfluxDB (for historical data)
  - Search: Elasticsearch

### Frontend
- Framework: React with TypeScript
